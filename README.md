## Preparation to work

Install NodeJS version 18.12.1 or use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node versions.

Copy this repository to your GitHub account:
1. Go to “Your repositories”
2. Click “New”
3. Select “Import a repository”
4. Paste the [Link](https://github.com/NedelevPhilip/react-practicum.git) to the repository
5. Make your repository public

**It must be an import of the repository, not a fork**

After the repository is copied to your account, you can clone it to your computer.

Install local DB with `npm install -g json-server `
db.json is located in the root of the project

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

Run `json-server --watch db.json --port 3004` to start the local DB on port 3004

Run `npm start` to start the project on port 3000
